# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English and British English), or Xs and Os/“X'y O'sies” (Ireland) is a paper-and-pencil game in which two players, X and O, take turns marking spaces in a 33-square grid. The winner is the player who successfully places three of their markers in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row. It's a solved game with a forced draw, if both players give it their all.
